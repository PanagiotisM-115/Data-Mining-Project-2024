A project for my university lesson regarding data mining.
We were given .csv files containing airbnb listing data from the following date periods:

Februrary/March/April of 2019

March/June/September of 2023

The data was cleaned and the necessary visualizations of the data were made for each of those years which helped
with making certain observations regarding average price changes as time passed.
